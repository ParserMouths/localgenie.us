# local-genie

Have you ever had a craving for pani-puri waale bhaiya who makes the best
pani-puri around your town but you find that he is not near his spot.
What can you do? You can't even go on Google Maps or some other place to find
information about stall's status.

Local-Genie has appeared to fulfill this request of yours. It can not only help
you find your favorite panipuri stall but also any local stall which is mobile.
Our Application(PWA) focuses on creating a platform for local-stall owners to get
discovered by their surrounding. We also provide an interface for users to discover
all the food-varieties that their locality has to offer.

Our app also provides you with the reviews on those stalls which will help you make a
better decision for your next place. Our idea can be extended to included all kinds of
local stall owners who rely on the crowd and are dynamic according to the needs of the
user.

## Tech Stack

- We have used **StoryBlok**'s headless CMS to deliver stories to our frontend.
- It drastically reduced speeds for fetching the data than fetching it from our servers.
- We have also used StoryBlok's asset store for storing and delivering all the images. 

### Frontendüñ•Ô∏è 
- React for UI and components
- Storyblok for components related to the information of stalls

### Backend üõ†Ô∏è
- Backend is microservice created in **Go** created with [fiber](https://gofiber.io/) framework.
- Architecture is based on Domain Driven Design, for scalability and cleaner repository design.
- PostgresSQL is used as database since the models were relational.
- Docker and Docker compose for developement and deployment environments.

## Problem we faced while developing this project.
Implementing StoryBlok SDK in goLang: As we have used storyblok to deliver the content to the users, we have to implement create, update and delete routes in the backend and read operation directly from the frontend. But Storyblok has sdk available only in javascript. Thus we have to implement storyblok sdk in the goLang. This includes implementing complex api‚Äôs like uploading vendor assets (images and other info) to CMS through backend. Being new to golang, that took lot of iterations to make it happen and was time consuming.

Sending push notifications to users nearby to vendors: Sending notifications in PWA if itself complex as it involves storing subscription objects for each of the user into the database. For our application we have to specifically target a subset of users around the vendor.

## Future Scope
- Add simple analytics for vendor.
- More security in app.
- Multilingual Support
